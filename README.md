# RandomDevNotes
A bunch of random dev related research notes, for personal referece, and for whoever it helps. Some of the pages will just have links, and some will have detailed explanations. I often spend hours doing research on various topics. That ofcourse involves a lot of googling. Saving the info that I find in one place (this repo) can save me hours of googling the next time I'm researching the same topic again. That's why I've made this repo.
